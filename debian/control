Description: library for immutable and fixed-size containers
 Header-only library that provides 0 cost initialization for immutable
 containers, fixed-size containers, and various algorithms.
 .
 Frozen provides:
 .
  - immutable (a.k.a. frozen), constexpr-compatible versions of std::set,
    std::unordered_set, std::map and std::unordered_map.
  - fixed-capacity, constinit-compatible versions of std::map and
    std::unordered_map with immutable, compile-time selected keys mapped to
    mutable values.
  - 0-cost initialization version of std::search for frozen needles using
   Boyer-Moore or Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithms.
 .
 The unordered_* containers are guaranteed perfect (a.k.a. no hash collision)
 and the extra storage is linear with respect to the number of keys.
 .
 Once initialized, the container keys cannot be updated, and in exchange,
 lookups are faster.
 .
 This package contains the necessary headers.
